## Bingo Game Python

  - Using Python Random we generate a computer card and a user card.
  - All numbers in the cards are unique.
  - Then again using Random we generate a number and check for it's existence in each card and remove that number from either one of the cards or from both cards depending upon the condition.
  - First card to cross all numbers wins.
